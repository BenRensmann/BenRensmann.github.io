Hello wanderers, I am Ben, a software engineer by day and indie game developer by night.

It is my honour to welcome you to yet another DevBlog in a sea of development-oriented blogs. I believe I am neither talented nor knowledgable enough to keep up with many of the truly informative blogs out there so I won't try to. Instead you can expect some over-enthusiastic posts about computer science concepts I find fascinating, game design techniques that enspire me or topics in either field I find rarely talked about.

In short, most of this blog is probably redundant, therefore the name. If that is fine with you, lets take a walk...
